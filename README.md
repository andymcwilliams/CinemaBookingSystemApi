# Build and Run

```dotnet run --launch-profile https```

The default browser is launched to https://localhost:<port>/swagger/index.html, where <port> is the randomly chosen port number displayed in the output. There is no endpoint at https://localhost:<port>, so the browser returns HTTP 404 Not Found. Append /swagger to the URL, https://localhost:<port>/swagger.
